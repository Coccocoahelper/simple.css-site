title: Introducing Simple Classes
description: We have introduced a couple of Simple Classes to make your life easier.
---

After feedback and discussion from a number of our users, we have decided to add two simple, yet effective classes to Simple.css. As of today, you will be able to use the `.button` and `.notice` classes in your projects.

If you want to add them to your project, you would do so like this:

```
/* Add a link that looks like a button */
<a class="button" href="https://example.com">This is a link button</a>

/* Add a notice box */
<p class="notice">This is a notice box, you can use me to call attention to cetrain pieces of information.</p>
```
And this is what they look like when in use:

<a class="button" href="https://example.com">This is a link button</a>

{: .notice}
This is a notice box, you can use me to call attention to certain pieces of information.

## More classes?

If you have any ideas for additional classes or features we can add to the project, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css/issues).
