## Want to be added?

If you're using Simple.css for your project and want to be added to this Showcase, please [create and issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css-site/issues) or use the [contact page on my main site](https://kevq.uk/contact) to get in touch.

{: .notice}
**Note:** I will only add pages that have done something different with Simple.css. The vanilla project can be viewed on this site, so there's no point in me adding other sites that are using the vanilla project. Sorry.
